## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I found myself having to brush up on grid and flexbox, which took some time.
I also struggled with time management. I think I can do a better job of planning my weekly schedule when it comes to working on my project, now that I have an idea of what I can expect from the assignments.
